Requirements
------------
To run XML Authority Editor you will require Ruby (1.8.7), ruby-gnome and nokogiri.

The Windows distribution includes a ruby interpreter and all necessary libraries.

On a Mac, this should work:

sudo port install ruby
sudo port install rb-gnome
sudo port install rb-rubygems
sudo gem install nokogiri

On deb or ubuntu linux, this should work:

sudo apt-get install ruby
sudo apt-get install rubygems-rb18

Run XML Authority Editor
------------------
On Mac or Linux, open a terminal and navigate to your install folder. Enter 'ruby init.rb'.

Rubygems isn't loaded by default and this may cause an error.
You can either add it to your ruby defaults (edit your .profile/.bashrc file to
include the line 'export RUBYOPT=rubygems') or edit the environment.rb file
to include 'require "rubygems"' (uncomment the second line).

Windows users can just run the 'Authority Editor' shortcut in the install directory.

State Records New South Wales is unable to provide technical support for XML Authority Editor.
