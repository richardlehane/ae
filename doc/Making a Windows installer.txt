Making a Windows installer
-------------------------

If you've made changes to this application and would like to generate a custom Windows installer, you can do so quite easily.

Steps:

1) Download and install the full windows package on a windows machine (this includes pre-packaged versions of ruby, ruby-gnome and nokogiri)

2) Apply the changes you want to this windows version (i.e. if you are working on MAC or LINUX copy your changes over)

3) Change the default parameters in the AE_full_install.nsi file as appropriate (e.g. you may need to change the SOURCE_LOCATION parameter to point it to wherever you've installed AE locally e.g. "c:\Program Files\AE")

4) Get the nullsoft scriptable install system (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download) and run the AE_full_install.nsi script (by either right-clicking on the script and selecting 'compile NSIS script' or dragging it onto makensisw.exe).


Making an 'Upgrade' installer
-----------------------------

Also included is a simple NSIS script for patching existing installations of XML Authority Editor with your latest changes. The file is AE_upgrade.nsi. Follow the same steps as above.
